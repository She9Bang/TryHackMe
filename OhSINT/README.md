<h3> Room title : OhSINT </h3>
<p> This challenge only gives you an image to download, and then you have to use your Googling skills to answer all the questions in the room </p>
<p> Here is the image given, the classic Windows XP wallpaper ! </p>

<h3> The informations we need to find are : </h3>

<p> What is this users avatar of?
<p>What city is this person in?</p>
<p>Whats the SSID of the WAP he connected to?</p>
<p>What is his personal email address?</p>
<p>What site did you find his email address on?</p>
<p>Where has he gone on holiday?</p>
<p>What is this persons password?</p>

<h3> Let's start Oh-sinting </h3>
<p> Whenever i see an image, my first instinct is to use Exittool on it ! </p>
<p> The outcome is quite promissing </p>

<p> It seems like the only useful informations are the Copyrighht "OWoodflint" and the GPS coordinates ! </p>
<p> Let's search for "OWoodflint", We'll find a Twitter, Github, and Wordpress website <p>
<p> From His twitter,we can see that he used a cat as an avatar, and a twitter containing an SSID ! </p>

<p> By using Wigle.net, we can search for that SSID with the GPS coordinates we found earlier, to get the BSSID ! </p>
<p> From his Github, we can see the city he lives in and his Email </p>

<p> From his wordpress, we can find where he was in vacations, and by inspectig the source code, we see his password..right there in plaint sight xD </p>
