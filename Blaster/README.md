<p> With this room we will learn ways to manually exploit vulnerabilities, because you can't always rely on Metasploit and other tools ! </p>
<h3> I.Enumeration and Recon :</h3>
<p><b>Nmap scan results</b></p>

<p>It seems like there is a web server running, it's the ISS windows server, a web server that runs on the Microsoft .NET platform on the Windows OS</p>

<p>Let's run dirbuster and look for hidden directories</p> 
<p>Apparenlty there is an interesting /retro directory, </p>

<p>Let's give it a tour : see what we can find</p>

<p>So far, we have a username, and what appears to be the passwod (the user mentioned that he kept spelling the name of wade's avatar wrong whenever he logged it) !</p>

<p>As advices in the room, let's use these credentials to Log into the machine via Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP), for that we will use "remmina" simply instal it <b>"apt install remmina"</b> then launch it</p>

<p> We're in !</p>

<h3> II.Escalation :</h3>
<p>On the room, they asked to get a CVE the user searched for, so i went to IE history, haven't found anything !! i searched abit more here and there, then i *cheated* from another writeup, 
there was a "CVE-2019â€“1388" on the history ! maybe someone deleted it ? </p>
<img src="https://github.com/She9Bang/TryHackMe/blob/master/images/blaster7.png">
<p>The executable file for this CVE is on the user's desktop</p>
<p><b>Now, let's try to exploit it ! </b></p>
<p>Instead of boring you with details, here is a youtube video i followed that explains how to exploit it => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BQKpPNlTSo </p>
